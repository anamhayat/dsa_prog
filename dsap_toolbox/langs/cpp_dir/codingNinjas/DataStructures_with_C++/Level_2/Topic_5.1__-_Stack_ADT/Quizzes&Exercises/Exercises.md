**4. Stack implementation**

    Which of the following operation take worst case i.e. linear time (O(n)) in the array implementation of stack?

**Options**

    a. Push
    b. Pop
    c. IsEmpty
    d. None

<details> <summary><strong>Correct Answer</strong></summary>

    d. None

**5. Stack implementation**

    If the elements “p”, “q”, “r” and “s” are placed in a stack and are deleted one at a time, in what order will they be removed?

**Options**

    a. srqp
    b. pqrs
    c. srpq
    d. qrsp

<details> <summary><strong>Correct Answer</strong></summary>
