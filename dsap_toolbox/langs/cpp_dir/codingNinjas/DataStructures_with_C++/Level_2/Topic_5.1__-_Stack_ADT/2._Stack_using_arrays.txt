====== 2. Stack using arrays ======
Created Wednesday 22 January 2020

We want to create a stack using a static array, whose capacity will be set by the user.

We are controlling the ADT by using a class. Where only the interface functions are public, everything else is private.

Working:
	Our head is the lastIndex, as insertion and removal is O(1).
	We store this top(i.e lastIndex).
[[./stackUsingArray.cpp|stackUsingArray.cpp]]
[[./stackMain.cpp|stackMain.cpp]]
