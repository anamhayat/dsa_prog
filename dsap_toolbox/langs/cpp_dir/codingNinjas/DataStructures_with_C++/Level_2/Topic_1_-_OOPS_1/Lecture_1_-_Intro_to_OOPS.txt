* We want a style of programming where we can do work in like in real life. Our world is made up of objects, which have properties and interact with each other.
* This makes our programming very intuitive and relatable.

* Idea of a class:
	When we have to do work on similar objects, it is better that we have a template with type/contraint of the values. The template should also have all the functions through which the object iteracts, with itself or with other objects. So, effectively, a class is a **blueprint**.
	
* Idea of an object:
	An **object **is an instance of a class, and **occupies** some memory. On the other hand, class is a blueprint, so it does not occupy any memory.
--------------------
Syntax to create a class:
	class //class_name//
	//{//
		//data_type_1 attrib1;//
		//data_type_2 attrib2; // //only declarations, we can even do int marks[], i.e arrays too
	//};//
