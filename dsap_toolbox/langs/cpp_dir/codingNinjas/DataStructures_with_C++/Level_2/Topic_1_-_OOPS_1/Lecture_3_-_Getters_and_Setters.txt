====== Lecture 3 - Getters and Setters ======
Created Wednesday 08 January 2020

Reason for getters(accessers) and setters(mutators):
* Setters can check constraints imposed by us.

* Getters can change the 'form' of the output so that it is readable for the requestsee.
* It adds a layer of authorization. We may need to provide the passwords, as an argument.

--------------------
* When making a real world project, we **should **set the values of important(easy to misuse) data as private, in order to avoid any problems. 
* The security here does not mean from outsiders, mostly no. It is for accidental or other errors.
