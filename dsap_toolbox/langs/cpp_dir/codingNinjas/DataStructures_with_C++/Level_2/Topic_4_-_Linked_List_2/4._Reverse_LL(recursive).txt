====== 4. Reverse LL(recursive) ======
Created Saturday 18 January 2020

This is the most plain recursive method.
* Here we return the head of the LL.
* Connect the node in the current activation record and add it to the end, yes we would require traversing the LL for this.
* Put the head->next = NULL. As it has become the last node of the LL.
* Return the head of the LL.
Time Complexity  = o(n^{2})
This could be sped up, return the head and the last pointer both. i.e two pointers
