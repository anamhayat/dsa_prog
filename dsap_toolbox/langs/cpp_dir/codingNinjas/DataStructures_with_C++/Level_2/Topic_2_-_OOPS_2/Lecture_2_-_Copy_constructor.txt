====== Lecture 2 - Copy constructor ======
Created Friday 10 January 2020

The compiler provided copy constructor always does **shallow **copying, i.e does this->attribute = s.attribute for all attributes.

The second one is what we shoul do, and this is not provided by the compiler. 
We have to define a copy constructor with the part which deals with the memory as per our requirement.


**Copy constructor will have params as const references, otherwise it'll be infinite loop.**
{{./Selection_018.png}} Loop.
* Copy constructors will always need another type of constructor, since their very invocation requires that an object exist. And the **first **object can never be created by using a copy contsructor.
