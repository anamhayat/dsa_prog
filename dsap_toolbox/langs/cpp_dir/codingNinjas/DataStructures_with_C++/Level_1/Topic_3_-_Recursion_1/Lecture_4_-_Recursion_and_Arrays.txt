====== Lecture 4 - Recursion and Arrays ======
Created Saturday 28 December 2019

* Some problems are very tedious to solve using iterative methods, they may ultimately require a programmers stack. 
* Difference between head recursion and tail recursion.
	e.g check if given array is sorted or not
	 Method 1: if(n<=1) return true.
				if arr[0]<=arr[1] check further in f(arr+1, n-1)
				else return false;
					// it will ultimately reach n-1.
				**Tail recursion. Easier to convert to an iteration.**
	Method 2: if(n<=1) it is sorted by default.
				if(f(arr+1, n-1)==true)
					{
						if(arr[0] <=arr[1]
						return true;
					}
				return false;
				**Head recursion.** **Difficult to convert to an iteration.**
