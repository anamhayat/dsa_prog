====== Lecture 1 - Introduction to Recursion ======
Created Saturday 28 December 2019

* Recursion: When a **problem** can be expressed as the **same** problem with a **smaller** input input(until an anchor point obviously).
(Don't say that a function calls itself)
e. g factorial: i.e f(n) = n * f(n-1) , f(0) = 1.
* The anchor point is just a trivial instance of the problem. Whose answer is known to us.
* Recursion works by making a stack ofactivation records.
**Note: **We don't have to make activation records, as this is tedious. We'll see better representation in the next lecture.
* It's very intuitive and helpful in solving many problems.
