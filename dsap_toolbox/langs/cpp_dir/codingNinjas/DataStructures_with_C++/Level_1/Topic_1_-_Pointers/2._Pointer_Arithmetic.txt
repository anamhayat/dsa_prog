====== 2. Pointer Arithmetic ======
Created Saturday 21 December 2019

Addition and subtraction of integers is allowed with pointer variables(except **null** and **void** pointers). Other arithmetic operations such as multiplication and division are not allowed.
**Reason:** As we don't know the memory they reference and the jump, respectively. void* are increased by 1 in some compilers, but this is not allowed in -pedantic.
* When we do +2, we actually do +2*(data_type) . Same with subtraction.
* Variables declared together need not be continuos. 
* Array elements ae always continuos, that's the reason they are called arrays.
* Each +-1 adds/subtracts by the sizeof(data_type).
* Everthing in pointer-land is about offsets, not about the hexadecimal values.
Note: Pointers can be **compared** by using relational operators, such as ==, <, and >. If p1 and p2 point to variables that are **related** to each other, such as elements of the same array, then p1 and p2 can be meaningfully compared.
