====== Lecture 9 - Types of Balanced BST ======
Created Wednesday 12 February 2020

For the best insertion, deletion and other ops for a BST is O(H)
i.e if we can minimize h, then we can minimize the height.
* |H_{left }- H_{right}| <= 1 for all nodes.
* h = O(log(n))
* Search, insertion and deletion is O(h).

Types of balanced BSTs:
1. AVL tree - Read and implement.
2. Red-Black Tree
3. 2-4 tree
