====== Lecture 4 - Take input and print recursive ======
Created Saturday 25 January 2020

We want to achieve two things:
1. Print function - void printTree(TreeNode<T>* root)

* Tree has a very easy and intuitive structure, i.e print the root an call print on all the subtrees.
* We don't require **base cases** in generic trees, checking for NULL is an **edge case**. Both are different. Base case nake a recursion stop, while edge cases break the program or cause an error/exception.
* We don't require a base case coz we never hit a coming back point.
* The caller works as base case. 
* We never call from a NULL, coz we are using vectors, so we never use a garbage or empty list.

2. Input function
TreeNode<int>* takeInput()
{
	// ask root data
	// no. of children
	// call takeInput three, 3 subtrees done.
} 
* We create a node, only when we ask the value for it. This we don't have to keep a track of the variables for the children and all.
* No need of base case as input will be taken if no.of children > 0. Else it will hit brace. i.e we won't go any further.
* The function creates atleast one node.
* takeInput() is easy to make, but using it is difficult.

We'll be using recursion in 95% of the tree problems.
