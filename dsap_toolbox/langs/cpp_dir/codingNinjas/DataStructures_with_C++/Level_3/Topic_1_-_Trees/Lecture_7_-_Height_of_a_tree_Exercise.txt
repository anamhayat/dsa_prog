====== Lecture 7 - Height of a tree Exercise ======
Created Monday 27 January 2020

* Concept: Height is just the maximum number of levels in the tree.

* **We can say a single node is height 0 and also height 1. Definition is **//flexible//**. There's no convention here.**
* If we want to avoid negative numbers, we will be saying a **single node** is height **1**. As we will return 0 for NULL.
