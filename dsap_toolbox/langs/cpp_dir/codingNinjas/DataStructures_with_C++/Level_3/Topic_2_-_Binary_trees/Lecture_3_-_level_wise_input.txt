* create queue
* this is iterative
* take the root->data if it exists
* take the left child. attach it if given. push.
* take the right child. attach it if given. push.
Keep the root and trav different, as we need to return the root.

**Why do we use a queue?**
We have to process the nodes as they come, so this is the perfect place for a queue.
