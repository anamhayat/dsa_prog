====== Lecture 1 - What is a priority queue ======
Created Wednesday 12 February 2020

We have people in a queue?
How they** exit **is. And to keep the queue in order, we need to **insert **it nicely too.
What's the criteria:
1. Time(known as FCFS) i.e a normal FIFO queue.
2. VIP factor - By an authority
3. Criticality - Natural, e.g old age, medical condition.
Types of queues:
1. Min -  Lesser value is important.
2. Max - bigger value is important.

Priority queue ADT:
1. insert()
2. getMax() or getMin() - similar to top() in stack
3. removeMax or removeMIn - similar to pop() in stack.

Which data structure to use:
{{./Selection_041.png}}

Balanced BST is the way to go. nlogn after all insertions and deletions.
