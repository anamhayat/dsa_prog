====== Lecture 6 - In-place heap ======
Created Saturday 15 February 2020

* We need to convert an array into a heap.
* To start, visualize like this:
	a. The first element is a heap.
	b. We insert the a new element at the end o fthe array. Which it is, naturally.
	c. Here we sift the newly inserted element up. Till the heap property is satisfied.
	d. Eventually, we have a heap.
T.C for this operation:  

* We have a heap. To sort the elements, do this.
	a. removeMIn(). We swap the end of the heap and the root, i.e index 0.
	b. We sift the index 0 element down, until the heap order property is satisfied. Which will happen eventually.
	c. continue till we all the elements are over.

* We have the sorted array in decreasing(non-increasing) order.

* minHeap is used for reverse sort.
* max heap for sorting.
