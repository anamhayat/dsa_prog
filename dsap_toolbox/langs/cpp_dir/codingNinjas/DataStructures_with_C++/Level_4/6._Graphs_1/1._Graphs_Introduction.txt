====== 1. Graphs Introduction ======
Created Monday 30 March 2020

Graph is a data structure that can be used to represent a whole lot of real world problems:
1. Like a social media network.
2. Places connected via roads in a country.

Graph: A set of vertices and a set of edges(connecting them - does not mean all vertex have to be connected).

Trees vs Graphs:
Graphs can:
1. Have cycles.
2. Can have disjoint sets of graphs. i.e some vertex may be unreachable from any other vertex. e.g 2 friends who are not friends with another group. This makes our graph as two disjoint graphs(which are not disjoint further).

Trees(are a special case of graphs) - they are much more structured:
1. Don't have cycles.
2. Every vertex is reachable from any other vertex. i.e dijoint graphs are not possible.
