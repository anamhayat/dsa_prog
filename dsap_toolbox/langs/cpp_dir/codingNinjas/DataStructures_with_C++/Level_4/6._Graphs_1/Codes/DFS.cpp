/*
    We assume that DFS prints the whole graph.

    DFS works for n==1.

    DFS now is at a node and prints all the neighbours and the graphs starting from it.

    If the whole graph were accessible from it, It's already printed.

    else if some parts were missing.
    They'll be printed by neighbours of the predecessors for sure. Coz they are reachable by somebody. And we traverse everybody.
