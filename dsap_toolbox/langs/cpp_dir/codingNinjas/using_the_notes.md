1. Zim-wiki desktop was used to create these notes, so it is required to view the notes properly. Get it at [https://zim-wiki.org/]
2. Windows 10 has some resolution issues with Zim Wiki as it uses gtk3, although it runs fine. Linux runs it flawlessly.
3. After installing zim wiki, just run/execute the .zim file.
4. All the notes here are according to my understanding of the material. So use it at your own risk!!
5. These notes are not complete, very very simple basics have been ommitted.
6. draw.io was used for the flowcharts, shutter for screenshots and shotwell photo viewer for picture enhancement.
7. Eager to have some pull-requests/suggestions.
